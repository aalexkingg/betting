# Got to think about bes tway to automate getting bets for sports, and the leagues in those sports
#  E.g Premier league in football
# i reckon at the moment we just focus on getting a program where it takes the bets from the website and reports back the profitable matches and the possible bets
## and worry about the automation later

from bets import get_bets
# this is a test, alex is a queer

# tommy like dick in his ass
def main():
    t = get_bets()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
